    Initialize the database by recreating all tables.
    
    This function performs the following operations:
    1. Verifies the environment is development
    2. Creates an async database engine using the configured database URL
    3. Drops all existing tables to ensure a clean slate
    4. Creates all tables defined in the application's models
    5. Logs the progress and completion of the operation
    
    Use Cases:
    - Setting up a new development environment
    - Resetting the database during testing
    - Recreating tables after schema changes
    - Database migration and version control
    
    Note: This function should only be used in development environments
    as it will delete all existing data.
    
    Example:
        >>> asyncio.run(init_db())
        INFO: Dropped all existing tables
        INFO: Created all tables
        INFO: Database tables recreated successfully!

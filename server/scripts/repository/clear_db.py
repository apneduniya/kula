async def clean_db():
    """
    Clears all data from database tables while preserving table structure.
    
    This function performs the following operations:
    1. Verifies the environment is development
    2. Creates an async database engine
    3. Temporarily disables foreign key constraints
    4. Retrieves all table names
    5. Truncates each table to remove all data
    6. Re-enables foreign key constraints
    
    Use Cases:
    - Resetting test data between test runs
    - Clearing development environment for fresh start
    - Preparing database for new data migration
    - Debugging data-related issues
    
    Safety Features:
    - Only runs in development environment
    - Preserves table structure and relationships
    - Handles foreign key constraints properly
    
    Example:
        >>> asyncio.run(clean_db())
        INFO: Cleared data from table: users
        INFO: Cleared data from table: chats
        INFO: All database tables cleared successfully!
        
    Note: This function should only be used in development environments
    as it will delete all data from all tables.
